A Heimer input file consists of ? tags, enclosed by angled brackets, and the
corresponding information under each tag. These tags are as follows:

########## The <options> tag ##########

The optional <options> tag designates how to parse command line options to the
generated program. Each line under the <options> tag must be of the format
"FLAG ARG_NAME PRIMITIVE_TYPE", where FLAG is the flag designating the command line
option, ARG_NAME is the variable name used to store the value, and PRIMITIVE_TYPE is
one of int, bool or string. For instance:

<options>
    c count int

lets us know that -c is a command line option that is followed by a int. Our
generated code will parse text following -c as an integer, and store the result as a
global integer.

########## The <objects> tag ##########

The <objects> tag determines how the generated program will parse and store the input
text. Namely, information under this tag denotes which objects need to be generated,
as well as the names and types of the objects' fields. The order in which these
fields are specified determines the order in which we parse the input.

Additionally, an object may either span multiple (one or more) lines, or just a
single line. Objects that always span a single line are
