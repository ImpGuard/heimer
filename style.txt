Line
- 85 (or whatever we want) character line limit
- When splitting a line of code into multiple lines, make sure it's still easy to read and understand

Naming
- For variable names, use camel case and single-letter names are reserved for counter
- For function name, whatever that make sense

Spacing
- No tap, only spaces
- 4 spaces as indent
- Space after every comma
Ex.
    if spaceAfterComma( "code", "by", "wenson" ):
        print "Hooray"
    else:
        print "BOO"
- Space after opening parenthesis/bracket and before closing parenthesis/bracket, but not when there
is nothing inside the parthesis
Ex.
    foo( 1 )
    bar()
    map[ "Hi" ]
    sum( 1, 2, 3 )
    if ( "Hello", "World" ) == helloWorld():
        print "Yea!"
