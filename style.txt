Lines
- 85 (or whatever we want) character line limit
- When splitting a line of code into multiple lines, make sure it's still easy to read and understand

Naming
- Variables
    * Ideally clear enough to understand usage of the variable.
    * Camel case
    * Single-letter names are counters
- Methods & Functions
    * Camel case
- Files
    * Ideally one word, comments can describe file purpose.
    * Camel case

Spacing
- No tabs, spaces only
- 4 spaces as indent
- Space after every comma
Ex.
    if spaceAfterComma( "code", "by", "wenson" ):
        print "Hooray"
    else:
        print "BOO"
- Space after opening parenthesis/bracket and before closing parenthesis/bracket, but not when there
is only 1 or less arguments inside the parthesis
Ex.
    foo(1)
    bar()
    map["Hi"]
    sum( sum( 1, 2, sum( 1, 2, 3 ) ), 2, sum( 1, 2, 3 ) )
    if ( "Hello", "World" ) == helloWorld():
        print "Yea!"
